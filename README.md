# start-hardened-browser

A modified start-tor-browser which can be configured using environment variables
and a script to wrap it for compatibility. The plan is for this project to have
a finite lifespan, and have it's patches carefully upstreamed to the Tor Browser
Bundle so that ic can be used with other kinds of anonymous network.
