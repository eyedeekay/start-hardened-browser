# start-hardened-browser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/eyedeekay/start-hardened-browser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/eyedeekay/start-hardened-browser) **This status will be failed at any time that the start-tor-browser script in the upstream TBB differs from the start-tor-browser.orig script that is stored in this repository**

A modified start-tor-browser which can be configured using environment variables
and a script to wrap it for compatibility. The plan is for this project to have
a finite lifespan, and have it's patches carefully upstreamed to the Tor Browser
Bundle so that ic can be used with other kinds of anonymous network.
